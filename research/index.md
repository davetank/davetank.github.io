### Molecular Systematics

*This research addresses a range of questions including species delimitation, modes of speciation, the ecological and evolutionary consequences of polyploidy, climatic niche evolution, pollination biology, conservation, classification, and alpha taxonomy.*

**Diversification dynamics in Castillejinae -** correlating life history variation and chromosomal evolution to shifts in the rate of diversification in this species-rich group of primarily western North American plants.

**Evolution and systematics of the paintbrushes -** investigating the recent and rapid diversification of the ~180 perennial <i>Castilleja</i> species in western North America, Mexico, Central America, and Andean South America. The dissertation research of [*Sarah Jacobs*]({{ site.url }}/people/people.html) will be focused on this group.

**Evolution and systematics of <i>Bartsia</i> s.l. -** investigating the biogeography, evolution, and diversification of <i>Bartsia</i> in Andean South America, and placing this group in the context of the rest of the ‘European clade’ of Orobanchaceae. This was the dissertation research of former PhD student [*Simon Uribe-Convers*]({{ site.url }}/people/former-lab-members.html). 

**Evolution and systematics of <i>Lachemilla</i> (Rosaceae) -** dissertation research of  PhD student [*Diego Morales-Briones*]({{ site.url }}/people/people.html). This project is focused on the intergeneric relationships of <i>Lachemilla</i> and its relatives in the subtribe Alchemillinae of Rosaceae, and the putative adaptive radiation of <i>Lachemilla</i> in the mountains of Mexico, Central America, and Andean South America.

**Angiosperm phylogeny & evolution -** In addition to species-level molecular systematic studies, we collaborate with other research groups on resolving some of the remaining outstanding questions in angiosperm phylogeny and to use these phylogenies to investigate evolutionary questions. My systematic expertise is mostly centered on the large, diverse asterid clade, and these collaborations include family-level systematics in Orobanchaceae and Verbenaceae, as well as the major lineages of the Lamiales and Campanulidae. 


### Postdoctoral Researchers

**Maribeth Latvis** - Maribeth completed her PhD at the University of Florida in 2013, and joined the lab in January, 2014. Her PhD focused on the systematics and evolution of the South American clade of <i>Agalinis</i> (Orobanchaceae).

Maribeth is working on the diversification of the perennial clade of <i>Castilleja</i> (Orobanchaceae) in western North America.

{: .pull-right}

**Diego Morales-Briones** - Diego is from Quito, Ecuador and began working on his Ph.D. in January of 2012.

Diego is a Biology graduate student working on the systematics, evolution, and adaptive radiation of the genus <i>Lachemilla</i> (Rosaceae) in the páramos of Andean South America, and the historical biogeography of <i>Lachemilla</i>, <i>Alchemilla</i>, and <i>Aphanes</i>.

{: .pull-right}

**Sarah Jacobs** - Sarah is from Arkansas, but has been on the Palouse for several years - she completed a MS across the border at Washington State University working on the phylogeny of <i>Hydrangea</i>. Sarah joined the lab as a Biology Ph.D. student in August of 2012.
 
Sarah is working on species delimitation and diversification dynamics of several species complexes in <i>Castilleja</i> (Orobanchaceae).
