### David C. Tank

{: .pull-right}

Professor, [Department of Botany](https://www.uwyo.edu/botany/)
Director, [Rocky Mountain Herbarium](https://www.rockymountainherbarium.org)

PhD, University of Washington
Postdoc, Yale University and Peabody Museum of Natural History

My goal as an advisor is to help graduate students become broadly trained in plant systematics and & phylogenetics while they develop as independent researchers by learning to identify interesting questions and the approaches necessary to address those questions.

### Postdoctoral Researchers
<!--
![Anahi Espindola]({{ site.url }}/images/bio-photo-Espindola.jpg)
{: .pull-right}

**Anahi Espindola** - Anahi is from Argentina, and completed her PhD at the University of Neuchatel in Switzerland where she studied comparative phylogeography of plant-pollinator interactions.

Anahi is now working on a collaborative project with [Jack Sullivan](http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~jacks/) and [Bryan Carstens](http://carstenslab.org.ohio-state.edu/OSU/Carstens_Lab.html) investigating the comparative phylogeography of the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest, and developing tools to identify cryptic diversity in disjunct biomes.

### Graduate Students
*PhD students*

![Malia Santos]({{ site.url }}/images/bio-photo-Santos.jpg)
{: .pull-right}

**Malia Santos** - Malia completed her BS in Biology at Willamette University in 2016, and started her PhD with me and [Jack Sullivan](http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~jacks/) at the University of Idaho, before moving with me to the University of Wyoming in 2021.
 
Malia is a PhD student in the [UW Program in Ecology and Evolution (PiEE)](https://www.uwyo.edu/pie/). Her dissertation is focused on phylogenomics and macroevolution in both <i>Tricalysia</i> (Rubiaceae) and <i>Castilleja</i> (Orobanchaceae).

{: .pull-right}

**Caroline Brose** - Caroline is a PhD student in the [UW Program in Ecology and Evolution (PiEE)](https://www.uwyo.edu/pie/), and joined the lab in 2022 after completing her undergraduate degree at Colorado College. 

Her research is focused on the systematics of North American willows (<i>Salix</i>) where she is especially interested in species delimitation in arctic-alpine disjunctions, sympatry, and polyploid evolution.

{: .pull-right}

**Erin Bentley** - Erin completed her BS at the University of Wyoming and started her PhD woking with Dr. Alex Buerkle before joining the Tank Lab in the summer of 2022.

Erin's research uses population genomic and phylogenomic approaches to study the evolution of rarity using <i>Penstemon</i> and <i>Yermo</i> as model systems. In addition, Erin is informal education and outreach using transdisciplinary approaches that integrate art and science.

**Dan Turck** - Dan completed his BS in Resource Conservation with and emphasis in Ecology  at the University of Montana in 2010, and worked in the Pacific Northwest forests and in Antarctica before joining the lab in 2018.
 
Dan is a Biology PhD student at the University of Idaho (he stayed there...) working on our collaborative project (with [Jack Sullivan](http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~jacks/)) investigating the comparative phylogeography of the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest.
