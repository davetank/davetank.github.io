### David C. Tank

My goal as an advisor is to help graduate students become broadly trained in plant systematics and & phylogenetics while they develop as independent researchers by learning to identify interesting questions and the approaches necessary to address those questions.

{: .pull-right}

**Maribeth Latvis** - Maribeth completed her PhD at the University of Florida in 2013, and joined the lab in January, 2014. Her PhD focused on the systematics and evolution of the South American clade of <i>Agalinis</i> (Orobanchaceae).

Maribeth is working on the diversification of the perennial clade of <i>Castilleja</i> (Orobanchaceae) in western North America.

**Diego Morales-Briones** - Diego is from Quito, Ecuador and began working on his Ph.D. in January of 2012.

Diego is a Biology graduate student working on the systematics, evolution, and adaptive radiation of the genus <i>Lachemilla</i> (Rosaceae) in the p√°ramos of Andean South America, and the historical biogeography of <i>Lachemilla</i>, <i>Alchemilla</i>, and <i>Aphanes</i>.

**Sarah Jacobs** - Sarah is from Arkansas, but has been on the Palouse for several years - she completed a MS across the border at Washington State University working on the phylogeny of <i>Hydrangea</i>. Sarah joined the lab as a Biology Ph.D. student in August of 2012.
 
Sarah is working on species delimitation and diversification dynamics of several species complexes in <i>Castilleja</i> (Orobanchaceae).
