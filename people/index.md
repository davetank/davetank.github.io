My goal as an advisor is to help graduate students become broadly trained in plant systematics and & phylogenetics while they develop as independent researchers by learning to identify interesting questions and the approaches necessary to address those questions.

{: .pull-right}

**Maribeth Latvis** - Maribeth completed her PhD at the University of Florida in 2013, and joined the lab in January, 2014. Her PhD focused on the systematics and evolution of the South American clade of <i>Agalinis</i> (Orobanchaceae).

Maribeth is working on the diversification of the perennial clade of <i>Castilleja</i> (Orobanchaceae) in western North America.

**Anahi Espindola** - Anahi is from Argentina, and completed her PhD at the University of Neuchatel in Switzerland where she studied comparative phylogeography of plant-pollinator interactions.

Anahi is now working on a collaborative project with [Jack Sullivan](http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~jacks/) and [Bryan Carstens](http://carstenslab.org.ohio-state.edu/OSU/Carstens_Lab.html) investigating the comparative phylogeography of the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest, and developing tools to identify cryptic diversity in disjunct biomes.

**Diego Morales-Briones** - Diego is from Quito, Ecuador and began working on his PhD in January of 2012.

Diego is a Biology graduate student working on the systematics, evolution, and adaptive radiation of the genus <i>Lachemilla</i> (Rosaceae) in the p√°ramos of Andean South America, and the historical biogeography of <i>Lachemilla</i>, <i>Alchemilla</i>, and <i>Aphanes</i>.

**Sarah Jacobs** - Sarah is from Arkansas, but has been on the Palouse for several years - she completed a MS across the border at Washington State University working on the phylogeny of <i>Hydrangea</i>. Sarah joined the lab as a Biology PhD student in August of 2012.
 
Sarah is working on species delimitation and diversification dynamics of several species complexes in <i>Castilleja</i> (Orobanchaceae).

**Megan Ruffley** - Megan completed her BS in Botany at Miami University in 2015, and joined the lab in August of 2015.
 
Megan is a PhD student in the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology program, and is co-advised with [Jack Sullivan](http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~jacks/). She is working on our collaborative project investigating the comparative phylogeography of the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest.

{: .pull-right}

**Ian Gilman** - Ian is from Pennsylvania, and completed his BS in Physics at Bucknell University in 2015. Ian joined the lab as a Biology MS student in August of 2015.
 
Ian is working on the systematics and biogeography of <i>Cordylanthus</i>, <i>Chloropyron</i>, and <i>Dicranostegia</i>, all annual members of Castillejinae (Orobanchaceae), with a focus on the relative roles of niche convervatism and niche evolution on diversification.
