# Plant Systematics & Evolution

**August 2021:** The Tank Lab has joined the [*Department of Botany*](http://www.uwyo.edu/botany/) and the [*Rocky Mountain Herbarium*](https://www.rockymountainherbarium.org) at the [*University of Wyoming*](http://www.uwyo.edu).

The Tank Lab studies plant biodiversity. Much of our research is focused on the application of phylogenetic and phylogeographic methods to understand plant evolution - from the systematics and evolution of closely related groups of species to macroevolutionary patterns of diversification in seed plants.

In addition, we are continuing the long tradition of discovering and documenting the flora of the Rocky Mountain region through targeted floristic inventories and the digitization of historical collections.
 
Check out the [**research page**]({{ site.url }}/research.html) to learn more about how we use phylogenies to address evolutionary questions in plants and to better understand plant biodiversity through collections-based research.
