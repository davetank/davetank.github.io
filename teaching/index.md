## Current courses

### Structure and Function Across the Tree of Life (BIOL 213)

*4 credits, Spring; 3 lectures & 1 3-hr lab per week; co-taught with [Dr. Christine Parent](http://www.uidaho.edu/sci/biology/faculty/christine-parent)*

This course builds on introductory biology to examine some of the morphological and physiological similarities and differences that exist across the tree of life in a comparative framework, and to to learn how plants and animals have evolved morphological structures and physiological processes to adapt to the common challenges faced by all organisms.

### Phylogenetics Reading Group (PuRGe; BIOL 536)

*1 credit, Fall & Spring; 1 discussion per week*

Phylogenetic methods have become increasingly necessary to address questions at all levels of biological diversity, ranging from the evolution of molecules, to organisms and communities. PuRGe meets once a week and different participants choose relevant papers and lead a discussion. All students, postdocs, and faculty are welcome - the goal being to gain a broader understanding of phylogenetic methods and their application to the investigation of evolutionary questions in biological systems.

Graduate students are encouraged to enroll for credit, but enrollment is not mandatory for participation.

*This research addresses a range of questions including species delimitation, modes of speciation, the ecological and evolutionary consequences of polyploidy, climatic niche evolution, pollination biology, conservation, classification, and alpha taxonomy.*

**Diversification dynamics in Castillejinae -** correlating life history variation and chromosomal evolution to shifts in the rate of diversification in this species-rich group of primarily western North American plants.

**Evolution and systematics of the paintbrushes -** investigating the recent and rapid diversification of the ~180 perennial <i>Castilleja</i> species in western North America, Mexico, Central America, and Andean South America. The dissertation research of [*Sarah Jacobs*]({{ site.url }}/people/people.html) will be focused on this group.
